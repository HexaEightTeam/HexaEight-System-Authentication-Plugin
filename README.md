# HexaEight-System-Authentication-Plugin

Implement HexaEight Authentication in Linux, Raspberry Pi, Windows, Mac and even custom Operating Systems

Getting Started:

HexaEight Systen Authentication Plugin uses PAM authentication for authenticating email users in all flavour of Linux (x64 version) and Raspberry pi devices (arm_64 version).  The authentication plugins for Windows and Mac will be updated once its ready.

**Note : Linux Operating Systems cannot have @ as part of the username, as such, it is not possibl to input email address in the username. Hence HexaEight PAM module replaces @ with a -- (doublehash) when mapping email address to linux usernames**
